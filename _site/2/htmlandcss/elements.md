# HTML Elements

Snowman follows the Twine 2 standard of using `<tw-storydata>` and `<tw-passagedata>` elements to store information about the story and individual passages. Beyond this, Snowman 2.X also uses a `<tw-story>` element as the story rendering area.

During a passage transition, the contents of the `<tw-passge>` element is replaced. The element with the class `passage` will always be a child of the `<tw-story>` element with the class "main". However, it may not be the only child.
