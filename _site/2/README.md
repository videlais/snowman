# Snowman 2.0 Documentation

Snowman is a minimal Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know JavaScript and CSS originally created by Chris Klimas. It is currently being maintained by Dan Cox.

## What is the difference between 1.X and 2.X?

While working on 1.4.0, it was decided that the codebase should also move from ES5 to more JavaScript ES6 functionality. This was branched into what is now 2.X and more functionality was added from there.

The main difference for most users is that 2.X uses different event names than 1.X and also adds some new global functions.

## What does Snowman offer?

Snowman does not use macros like Harlowe, SugarCube, and other story formats. Instead, it has two global objects, `window.story` and `window.passage`, that expose functionality for working with the overall story and current passage respectively through JavaScript.

The libraries [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/), and [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) are also included and available globally as `window.$`, `window._`, and `window.marked`.

Starting with 2.0, Snowman now also uses the full [Babel Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill) to simulate any missing JavaScript ES2015 functionality in the browser.
