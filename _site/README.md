# Snowman

Snowman is an advanced Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know JavaScript and CSS. It was originally created by Chris Klimas and is currently maintained by Dan Cox.

## What does Snowman offer?

Snowman does not use macros like Harlowe, SugarCube, and other story formats. Instead, it uses template tags `<% ... %>` and exposes a JavaScript API for manipulating the story and its passages.

It also includes the JavaScript library [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
