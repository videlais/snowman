# Snowman 2.1.0

Snowman is a minimal Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know JavaScript and CSS originally created by Chris Klimas. It is currently maintained by Dan Cox.

## What does Snowman offer?

Snowman does not use macros like Harlowe, SugarCube, and other story formats. Instead, it has two global objects, `window.story` and `window.passage`, that expose functionality for working with the overall story and the current passage, respectively.

It also includes the JavaScript libraries [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/).

Additional styling options are supplied through the inclusion of the [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library.
